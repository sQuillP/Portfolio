As we all know, in order to get into a lot of big-tech companies, or just any company in general as a software engineer
you will have to go through a hiring process that more often than not will have some sort of a technical
assessment to see if your skills are up to par with company standards. They will often assess your thinking/decision
making through the process of solving one or many LeetCode-style questions. These types of questions will gauge 
your understanding of data structures and algorithms, and whether or not you can come up with the optimal solution,
which is measured in big-O notation.

# LeetCode: A nightmare for Uninformed Developers

These types of assessments are often the focal point of make-it or break-it when it comes to getting the job offer.
LeetCode questions are also nightmare fuel for developers who have never taken the time to study data structures and algorithms
to begin with. This was me roughly a year ago. I had the basics, but I felt that I didn't have a good enough understanding of 
topics like backtracking, or dynamic programming. So I took it into my own hands to make sure that I study DSA more closely.

# Starting as a Newbie

When I first started solving LeetCode questions, I could only solve a few mediums and I struggled with the easy questions.
I quickly realized that medium category was still out of my reach as there were many concepts that were too difficult for me
to grasp well at the time. With that being said I started out just solving as many easy problems as I possibly could and eventually 
became a faster problem solver, being able to solve many easy problems in about 20-30 minutes or less.

# Setting Goals 

After a few months of solid dedication to the platform, I decided that instead of jumping right to the medium questions after feeling comfortable
with the easy questions, I made it my goal to first solve all the easy questions that are available to non-members, which is around 800 questions.
With this logic in mind, I would have no more easy questions left to do, forcing me to start learning the medium questions. I considered this a type of 
"mastery" in some sense, since I have already gained full insight into the easy category.

Once I finished the easy category, I set a goal to solve at least 500 medium questions by the end of the year 2024, of which I considered to be a substantial
enough number to be at since most people only solve a fraction of that and still get into big tech companies. But I wanted to go further than even those people.
I surpassed 500 medium questions and at this point I was very happy with my progress. I finally understood concepts like backtracking, dynamic programming,
DFS, BFS, graphs, Tries, you name it. I've likely done it. 

It is honestly crazy to think about the fact that I probably have more knowledge of DSA than most of my 
coworkers, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm a better programmer. I am now able to solve questions I never thought would have been possible a year go.
It still amazes me that with the right motivation, you can really find yourself amazed at what you can really accomplish.

After doing enough problems you will also find out a lot of the main topics that platforms like LeetCode revolve around. With enough practice,
you will be able to recognize enough patterns to solve questions at an exponential rate.

# What I've learned

- **Think about core concepts** - Lots of questions are based on the same core concept i.e *stacks, queues, arrays, hashmaps etc*. By thinking in these
terms, you will have new insight to solving a problem.

- **Searching the answer should be the last option** - Searching the answer to a problem should be the last option for you. If the problem is out of your league,
skip it altogether. Even after looking at the solution and it still doesn't make sense, do not solve the problem.
Just skip it and try for something easier, and then come back to that same problem after you have more insight.

- **Look at the hints/topics** - these are highly helpful as they will definitely help steer you in the direction that your problem solving skills need to go.
If the hint says **BFS** or **DFS**, you should consider those possibilities.

- **Write your thinking process down** - I 10/10 recommend that before writing any code down whatsoever, you should first begin creating a 
multi-line comment in your function/method that will detail your thinking process. Consider writing pseudo-code and verify your logic before
writing anything. After all, how would you know what to write in the first place if you don't know how to solve the problem. As a side note, I 
would also recommend you use a whiteboard or whiteboard software equivalent to diagram your thinking as well as this is also extremely helpful.

- **Have a good language choice** - Sorry to break it to you, but I definitely don't recommend using C as the language of choice to 
implement an algorithm like Djikstra. If you want life to be easy for you, please choose a language that has a rich set of DSA features like 
Python3, Java, or C++. It might help to write a priority queue from scratch once or twice, but after the 15th time you should probably use a language
that provides a strong set of data structures like heaps.

## Future Goals

I plan on hopefully participating on the bi-weekly and weekly contests that are hosted by LeetCode sometime soon. I hope to possibly hit 1000 medium
questions solved by the end of this year in 2025. I know this sounds like a smaller number but I do have other projects that I would like to get finished 
with so I prefer that LeetCode does not take up all of my free-time.

## Thoughts Overall

I honestly have no regrets from this learning journey as I have been able to think much better as a programmer. I feel like I can think at a much 
faster pace than I used to. Despite that LeetCode and DSA is often a metric to assess engineers who are interviewing for jobs, I find that DSA should be 
treated as an essential toolbelt for a programmers every day tasks.
