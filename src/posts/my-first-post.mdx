After a cold month in February, I have been finally able to finish my developer
portfolio! I stuck to a simple but effective design. In the bulk of this post,
I will be talking about the exact tools, styles, and platform that were used along what I have learned
in the process of building my portfolio.

## Step 1: Design

I am certainly no design expert when it comes to building frontend websites. Though this is definitely something
that I am refining day-by-day, I wanted to make sure that my design choices would not make other professionals
think "What is he thinking with these features?". I recently stumbled across a popular frontend developer on YouTube named 
named [Anthony Sistilli](https://www.youtube.com/@AnthonySistilli), who often makes video reviews of portfolio 
websites sent in by his viewers. With that being said, I found some great portfolio website designs to choose from,
and then began the next step in the portfolio-making process.

## Step 2: Framework

Before making my portfolio site, I had good prerequisite knowledge of the React.js framework. I knew that React did not have good SEO, and is definitely not the most performant framework 
as-is. I have heard many good things about Next.js recently, especially with out-of-the-box capabilities like cachine, routing, SSR, SSG, and
ISR. Since Next.js is already built on top of react, my next logical step to take was to start learning this framework 
by **doing**.

## Step 3: Features

- **LeetCode Showcase**: I made it a goal last year to do more than 500 medium leetcode problems to deepen
my knowledge in the field of data structures and algorithms. I was able to make it to rank ~6000 recently which 
I never thought I would be able to do. Hard work definitely pays off and I don't plan to stop using this site any 
time soon.
- **Resume / Work Information**: Including your resume details on your portfolio site is essential to the employer to gain
insight on your accomplishments and work history.
- **Including a blog**: It always helps to convey passions through writing. Having a blog will provide a more 
complete picture of your ambitions and goals, and most importantly, what you care about.
- **Contact Page**: Providing a contact page will greatly simplify the gap for people who wish to reach out to you.
- **Projects**: Maybe one of the most important items to include along with work history. Adding personal projects will 
help supplement your work history and will demonstrate that you take learning outside of the office.

## Step 4: Libraries

Ok, so now that I have an outline of the design, features, and choice of framework,
it is now time to look into the libraries that I used to build this site:

- **[Resend](https://resend.com/home)**: Resend is a powerful library that allows for sending emails at scale.
It is marketed as "Email for developers" and provides an easy subset of tools to get started with 
sending emails.
- **[canvas-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti)**: As the name implies, I use confetti on this site
- **[gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter)**: Helps with parsing .MDX files and metadata
- **[next-mdx-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-mdx-remote/v/0.5.1)** A set of light utilities allowing mdx to be loaded within ```getStaticProps``` or ```getServerSideProps``` and hydrated correctly on the client.

And that's it! I decided not to go with Tailwind or any other UI library. Even though it 
probably could have taken less time to develop, I felt that it wasn't really necessary as many of the 
features were very simple to implement.

## Step 5: üåë/‚òÄÔ∏è

You can't have a real portfolio site until a light/dark mode is added. Why else would people prefer
to burn their eyes when viewing your content? Since I didn't have any UI libraries to 
configure, I just did it from scratch, which was suprisingly simple.
In case you're curious, it took only ~44 lines (with generous spacing). You can check it out

Once completing these 5 steps, you should have a great looking website up in no-time!
